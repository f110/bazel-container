# bazel-container

bazel-container is an unofficial container for running [Bazel](https://bazel.build).

The bazel project does not publish a container officially.
But they have plans to release an official container.

This container is intended to be used in my workflow until the official container is published.
Hence, It is not guaranteed to work all of the rules maintained by the bazel project and others.

Feel free to use it in your workflow and the patch is welcome!
